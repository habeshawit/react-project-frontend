Welcome to Simple Sales, a simple version of an app where users can buy and sell items. 

To get started, you will need to also clone the backend repo at: https://github.com/habeshawit/react-project-backend

## Installation

### Backend

In the backend repository, open a terminal and run the following commands to set up the back end database:

```
$ git clone 
$ bundle install
$ rails db:create && db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
$ rails s
```

### Frontend

Once you have the backend running, in the frontend project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.

You can also open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
